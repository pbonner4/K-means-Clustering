# Clustering Crypto

Here is the full notebook code: [Clustering_Crypto.ipynb](https://github.com/pbonner4/Unit-13-Challenge/blob/master/Unit_13-Challenge/ClusteringCrypto/Clustering_Crypto.ipynb)

## Data Prep:

Data was imported via a csv file and prepared using standard preprocessing techniques in the starter jupyter notebook.

When using OneHotEncoder it was necessary to create two separates dataframes and then concatenate them twice to bring all the dummies and data together.

## K-Means:

The elbow curve indicated that 4 clusters would be the best cost-benefit efficient selection for the K-Means model.

Final Results can be seen a the end of my notebbok.
